# cyclistic_project
This capstone project was done as a result after finishing Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera. This project leads me to analyze historical bicycle trips to identify trends and also to get a better understanding of how casual riders do differently from annual members who have annual membership. Also, this analysis aimed to boost marketing decisions to assist the right marketing strategies, by converting casual riders into annual members. Data was acquired from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html to interpret the last 12 months data, from September 2021 to October 2022.
The goal of this project is to get insights into how to run an effective marketing campaign to convert casual users into annual members. My role in this project was as a full-stack data analyst, who worked from initiating the hypothesis, scraping the data from the source, and doing descriptive analysis. The method I used in this project was Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The whole project was done using R/RStudio, using packages such as tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, and more.
