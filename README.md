# cyclistic_project
This capstone project was done as a result after finishing Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera. This project leads me to analyze historical bicycle trips to identify trends and also to get a better understanding of how casual riders do differently from annual members who have annual membership. Also, this analysis aimed to boost marketing decisions to assist the right marketing strategies, by converting casual riders into annual members. Data was acquired from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html to interpret the last 12 months data, from September 2021 to October 2022.
